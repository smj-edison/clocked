# clocked

Clocked is a library that manages multiple asynchronous streams of audio and audio related data (currently audio streams and MIDI). It creates a global clock between multiple streams. It automatically detects and compensates for clock drift in audio streams. It also aligns incoming MIDI to the global clock.
